Language Explorer (FLEx), http://fieldworks.sil.org/flex/

FieldWorks Language Explorer (or FLEx, for short) is designed to help field linguists perform many common language documentation and analysis tasks. It can help you:

1. elicit and record lexical information
2. create dictionaries
3. interlinearize texts
4. analyze discourse features
5. study morphology

Note that the conversion is based on the ITG XML export for the original samples provided. FLEx does not provide a DTD or XSD for its native XML format (!)
