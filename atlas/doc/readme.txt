Atlas documentation

Drawn (directly or indirectly) from http://xml.coverpages.org/atlasAnnotation.html.

Here, we operate with Atlas Level 0, i.e., Annotation Graphs (AG)

Note that the original Atlas sites at NIST and LDC are down.
The format is, however, practically important for 
generalizing over timeline-based annotation formats (e.g., ELAN, Exmaralda) as it has been employed
to develop a generalization by this community (Schmidt et al. 2009).
